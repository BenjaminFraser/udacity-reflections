When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-Keeping a remote repository rather than just a standalone local repository makes logical sense for a whole host of reasons, 
the main one being that in the event of corruptiong or loss of data of your local repository, you still retain a full copy
of all your hard earned work. Keeping a repository up to date remotely also allows collaboration easily with others, and 
presents much more opportunity to work well as a team, without issues of requiring access to the local repository. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- If I was away in a remote location, with no access to the internet, and decided to use my spare time to work a little on a current web app project, then the problem with git automatically pulling changes to my computer is that I may pull old files that I actually changed whilst away. Another aspect is that the work done to the remote repository may have been done by another member of the team, and the work he/she carried out is not actually appropriate for the web app, and so you'd like to have the option of pulling this data, rather than it being forced unwillingly.
